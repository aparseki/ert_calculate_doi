electrical resistivity tomography script for determining depth of investigation using Oldenburg and Li

Oldenburg, D. W., & Li, Y. (1999). Estimating depth of investigation in dc resistivity and IP surveys. Geophysics, 64(2), 403-416.


Uses R2 to do inversion: http://www.es.lancs.ac.uk/people/amb/Freeware/R2/R2.htm

[please note: this is a development version of this script.  use at you own risk!]

Please note that these scripts have been superceded by the funcionality within ResIPy: https://gitlab.com/hkex/resipy I am keeping this repository open in case anyone wants to see my approach to the calculation, but I stronly recommend using the ResIPy codebase rather than ert_calculate_doi.
